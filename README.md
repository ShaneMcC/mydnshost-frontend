# mydnshost-frontend

This repo holds the code for the main frontend for mydnshost.

This code interacts with the JSON API exposed by https://github.com/ShaneMcC/mydnshost-api and presents a nice Web UI for managing DNS entries stored in the backend.

The code can be run either with Docker or directly on a server, though for the most part production use is only tested as a docker container.

## Running

TODO...

(Generally: check out the code, `git submodule update --init`, `composer install`, edit config.local.php, run `php admin/init.php` to update the database.)

## Comments, Questions, Bugs, Feature Requests etc.

At some point I'll add more to this README so that this isn't just a code-dump, but for now Bugs and Feature Requests should be raised on the [issue tracker on github](https://github.com/shanemcc/mydnshost-api/issues), and I'm happy to recieve code pull requests via github.

I can be found idling on various different IRC Networks, but the best way to get in touch would be to message "Dataforce" on Quakenet (or chat in #Dataforce), or drop me a mail (email address is in my github profile)
